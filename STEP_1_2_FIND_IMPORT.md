# 🔍 How to Import Your Existing Project

**You're on the template page, but we need to import your existing project instead!**

---

## 🎯 What to Look For

Instead of using templates, we need to **import your existing project**.

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Option 1: Look for "Import Project" Button

**1. Look at the TOP of the page:**
   - You should see navigation buttons
   - Look for: **"Import Project"** or **"Add New Project"**
   - Click on that button

### Option 2: If You See "Add New Project"

**1. Click "Add New Project"** (usually a big button)
**2. You should see options like:**
   - "Import Git Repository" ✅ (This is what we want!)
   - "Deploy" 
   - "Browse Templates" (this is what you're seeing now)

**3. Click "Import Git Repository"** or **"Import"**

### Option 3: Use the Navigation

**1. Look at the TOP navigation bar:**
   - You might see tabs like: "Dashboard", "Projects", "Deployments"
   - Click on **"Projects"** or **"Dashboard"**
   - Then look for **"Add New Project"** or **"Import"** button

## ✅ What You Should See

After clicking "Import Project" or "Import Git Repository", you should see:

**Option A: Connect to Git Provider**
- "Import from GitHub" button
- "Import from GitLab" button  
- "Import from Bitbucket" button

**Option B: Deploy via CLI**
- Instructions to use `vercel` command
- This is what we'll use if you don't have Git set up

## 🎯 Next Steps

**If you see "Import from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket":**
- Tell me which one you want to use
- I'll guide you through connecting it

**If you DON'T have your project in Git:**
- We'll use the **Vercel CLI** method instead
- This is easier and faster!

## ❓ Can't Find Import Button?

**Try this:**
1. Look for a **"+"** icon (plus sign) - usually in top right
2. Or look for **"New Project"** button
3. Or go to: **https://vercel.com/new** (direct link to import page)

**Tell me what you see! Do you see an "Import Project" or "Import Git Repository" option?** 🚀
